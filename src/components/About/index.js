      <p>Hello my name is Semi. I am working through a coding bootcamp and hope to pursue a job in this field after. I don’t have a lot of experience in coding other than the boot camp I’m doing right now. Some jobs I used to work in construction in the past which helped instill in me is a sense of punctuality and work ethic. I am willing to spend however many hours it will take to learn whatever I need to succeed in this field.</p>
